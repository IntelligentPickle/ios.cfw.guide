title: Using Jailbreak.me
---

{% include toc title="Table of Contents" %}

The Jailbreak.me tool for iOS devices allows is capable of jailbreaking every 32 bit device on firmware version 9.1 up to 9.3.4.

Note that the Jailbreak.me exploit is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). You will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

If you this guide does not work we recommend you follow our [Installing HomeDepot](installing-homedepot) guide instead.

## Running Jailbreak.me

1. Open Safari on your iOS device
1. Go to the [jailbreak.me](https://jailbreak.me/){:target="_blank"} website
1. Tap "jailbreak me!"

Jailbreak.me will now install the temporary jailbreak on your device.

Tap `Share` -> `Add to home screen` for easier access to Jailbreak.me.
