After installing your jailbreak, you may want to install some repos ([repositories](faq#repos)). You can use these to install more tweaks on your device. To get you started, here is a list of some recommended options. A lot of these may already be installed on your device!

## BigBoss

{% capture big-boss %}
A default repo in most package managers, Big oss is one of the largest repos, with thousands of tweaks and modifications to install. It's an essential repo that the majority of jailbreakers rely on.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--info">{{ big-boss | markdownify }}</div>

## Dynastic Repo

{% capture dynastic %}
The Dynastic Repo offers a small selection of high quality tweaks for your device, which guarantee to improve the look and feel of iOS for you. While there may not be as many tweaks on here as on BigBoss, there are definitely some good tweaks on here which will be worth your time.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--primary">{{ dynastic | markdownify }}</div>

## Packix

{% capture packix %}
Packix is another repo with over a thousand packages available for download. It offers a wide range of themes and tweaks to install and is certainly an essential for your device.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--success">{{ packix | markdownify }}</div>

## ModMyi (Archive)

{% capture modmyi %}
Although now no longer updated, ModMyi is a good source of tweaks if you're on a lower version, as it has many tweaks for your older devices. Unfortunately, however, if you're on a newer firmware version, such as iOS 13, a lot of the tweaks won't be compatible with your device.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--warning">{{ modmyi | markdownify }}</div>

## SparkDev

{% capture sparkdev %}
SparkDev's repo includes a host of new tweaks which can enhance iOS, with many focusing on the iPhone X, including an impressive always-on OLED experience.

{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice--danger">{{ sparkdev | markdownify }}</div>

## nullpixel's Repo

{% capture nullpixel %}
This repo is a small one, but includes a crucial tool: TSS Saver. This allows you to save small bits of information related to iOS updates called "blobs". Saving these will allow you to update and downgrade to the specific firmware version that was available when you saved the blobs. It's important to save them with this tool every time a new update is released.

## Revulate's Repo

{% capture packix %}
Revulate's Repo includes lots of beta versions of some of his tools on the Dynastic Repo, but also has a good crash report tool to help make sense of errors.
