### Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware versions 12.3 and 12.3.1. However, for a short amount of time you can update to 12.4 to jailbreak on that firmware instead.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest version for these devices is 10.3.4, we can easily update to the desired firmware version, due to the age of the devices.

If you are already jailbroken on a lower firmware version, you must remove your jailbreak first and then update via iTunes to reach 12.4.
