1. Open the Settings application
1. Go to `General` -> `iX Storage`
  - This could be `iPhone Storage`, `iPad Storage` or `iPod Storage`
1. Scroll to the System Update downloaded and tap on it

  - If unc0ver crashes, open it again
1. Uncheck all options except `Restore rootFS`
1. Go to the jailbreak tab and press `Jailbreak`
1. Open the Settings application
1. Go to `General` -> `Software Update`
1. Download the software update but **do not install it**
1. Go back to `General`
1. Once downloaded, go to `iX Storage` like before
  - This could be `iPhone Storage`, `iPad Storage` or `iPod Storage`
1. Scroll to the System Update downloaded and tap on it
1. Tap `Delete`
1. Scroll to the unc0ver application and tap on it
1. Tap `Delete`
1. [Install unc0ver](installing-unc0ver){:target="_blank"} again like before but don't run it yet
1. Turn on Airplane Mode and run the jailbreak now
  - This may take several attempts, keep trying until it works
