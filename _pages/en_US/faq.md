<a name="faq_signing" />**Q:** What is “signing”?
{: .notice--info}

**A:** When Apple releases a new OS, they sign it. This means that the version can be officially updated/downgraded to from iTunes. When the new versions are released, there is a window of time where you can upgrade/downgrade to them. This is called the “signing window”.

<a name="faq_blobs" />**Q:** What are “blobs”?
{: .notice--info}

**A:** A blob is the term for a small piece of data that controls whether an iOS device can update to a certain firmware version or not. It allows you to install other iOS versions without them being signed, just as if they were actually signed. You can save blobs using [this guide](/blobs).
