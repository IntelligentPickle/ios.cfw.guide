### Required Reading

Unfortunately, there is currently no jailbreak available for firmware versions 9.0 to 9.0.2 on 32-bit devices. However, devices with an A6 processor, such as the iPhone 5, can update to 10.33 and use the Helix jailbreak instead.

This is achieved by simply updating through the Settings application normally. Because the latest version for these devices is 10.3.3, we can easily update to the desired firmware version, due to the age of the devices.

### Updating to 10.3.3

1. Plug your device into power and connect to the Internet with Wi-Fi
1. Tap `Settings` -> `General` -> `Software Update`
  - Ensure that the version you are updating to is 10.3.3
1. Download and install the update
