## What is jailbreaking?

Jailbreaking is a term used to describe the process that allows you to truly unlock the potential of your iOS device. Apple's OS is known for being extremely secure and that's partly because of how locked-down it is. Jailbreaking your device will allow you to break those restrictions and customize your device to how you like it.

Jailbreaking gives you the ability to install custom applications and "tweaks" from Cydia to customize and enhance the user experience. Jailbreaking is free and easy on most devices on iOS 11.3.1 and below.

## Is jailbreaking legal?

Jailbreaking in the US is perfectly legal. In 2010, the US Copyright Office declared jailbreaking to be an exception to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. You may want to check in your country as to whether it is legal there or not before proceeding.

## What is Cydia?

Cydia is a package manager that can be used on jailbroken iOS. This means that you can use it to install custom applications, tweaks and themes from it.

It can be considered similar to the iOS App Store, where you can install both free and paid software.

## What are tweaks?

Tweaks are typically software packages that can be installed to your device which transform the look and feel of your iOS device. With some exceptions, tweaks usually don't come with an app icon, but rather instead an area in the Settings app to change how the tweak acts. Simpler tweaks might not have these.

## What does this guide install?

Newer jailbreaks released for versions above iOS 9 will usually involve installing a custom app to your phone through your computer and then running that app to reapply the jailbreak after every reboot. You will also need to reinstall this custom app to your phone from your computer every 7 days.

Older jailbreaks may allow you to simply install the software once from your computer and then the jailbreak will be applied automatically on every boot, with no input from you, the user.

## What can I do once jailbroken?

- Gain full access to your device's OS
- Access Cydia, mentioned above
- Install themes to change the look and feel of your device
- Install tweaks to change how iOS behaves

## What should I know before starting?

Before following the steps of this guide, you must know the risks of jailbreaking: Every time you modify your system in any way, there is always a chance that you could lose user data and ability to jailbreak. It is, however, very rare for a system to be rendered completely unrecoverable.
{: .notice--warning}

- If no issues occur during installation, you will be jailbroken without any data loss
- Keep the device plugged into to a power source so that any unexpected power off will be prevented
- Jailbreaking allows you to unlock your system but can lead to data loss if you damage the OS
- You may be vulnerable to malware and other security issues after jailbreaking
- Your device warranty will become void after jailbreaking
