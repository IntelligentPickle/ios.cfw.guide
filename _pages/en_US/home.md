## What is jailbreaking?

Jailbreaking is a term used to describe the process that allows you to truly unlock the potential of your iOS device. Apple's mobile operating system is known for being extremely secure and that's partly because of how locked-down it is. Jailbreaking your device will allow you to break those restrictions and customize your device to how you like it.

Jailbreaking gives you the ability to install custom applications and "tweaks" (modifications) from a package manager to customize and enhance the user experience. Jailbreaking is free and easy on most devices.

## Is jailbreaking legal?

Jailbreaking in the US is perfectly legal. In 2010, the US Copyright Office declared jailbreaking to be an exception to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. You may want to check in your country as to whether it is legal there or not before proceeding.

## What is a package manager?

Package managers are used to install and uninstall community-made software to customize your device. Cydia and Sileo are both examples of package managers.

They can be considered similar to the iOS App Store, where you can install both free and paid software.

## What are tweaks?

Tweaks are typically software packages that can be installed to your device which transform the look and feel of your iOS device. With some exceptions, tweaks usually don't come with an app icon, but rather instead an area in the Settings app to change how the tweak acts. Simpler tweaks might not have these.

## What does this guide install?

The new [checkra1n](https://checkra.in/) jailbreak will install a jailbreak to your device from recovery mode which will need to be re-applied every reboot. This will allow you unlimited access to your device.

It works on any firmware above 12.3 on all devices, and will even work on all future firmware versions, due to the nature of the exploit. Unfortunately it's currently only able to be installed from MacOS, however a Windows version is coming in the future.

Other jailbreaks released recently will typically involve installing an app to your phone through your computer, and then running that app to reapply the jailbreak after every reboot. You will also need to reinstall this custom app to your phone from your computer every 7 days due to how Apple allows unofficial apps to be run.

Older jailbreaks may allow you to simply install the software once from your computer and then the jailbreak will be applied automatically on every boot, with no input from you, the user.

## What can I do once jailbroken?

- Gain full access to your device's OS
- Get access to a package manager, such as Cydia or Sileo
- Install themes to change the look and feel of your device
- Install tweaks to change how iOS behaves

## What should I know before starting?

Before following the steps of this guide, you must know the risks of jailbreaking: Every time you modify your system in any way, there is always a chance that you could lose user data and ability to jailbreak. It is, however, very rare for a system to be rendered completely unrecoverable.
{: .notice--danger}

- If no issues occur during installation, you will be jailbroken without any data loss
- Keep the device plugged into to a power source so that any unexpected power off will be prevented
- Jailbreaking allows you to unlock your system but can lead to data loss if you damage the OS
- You may be vulnerable to malware and other security issues after jailbreaking
- Your device warranty will become void after jailbreaking
